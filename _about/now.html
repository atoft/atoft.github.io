about: >
  <p>I graduated from Cambridge University at the end of June. Following an interrailing trip, I 
  moved to Brighton where I&apos;ve started as a graduate programmer at a video game developer 
  called Studio Gobo.</p>
  <p>In my own projects, I&apos;m doing some game development of my own while working 
  more on my C++ skills.</p>
  <p>This page will hopefully be updated often with things I&apos;m doing.
