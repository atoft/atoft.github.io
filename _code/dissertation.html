    Fast and realistic rendering of reflective surfaces is a challenging problem in real-time 3D
    graphics. In this project I aimed to implement a number of existing approaches to the problem,
    as well as a new technique for rendering reflections using cubemaps and depth
    textures. I integrated these techniques into the Unity game engine, and
    evaluated their relative merits based on their performance and by
    classifying their limitations and failure cases.

    will be posted here soon.
