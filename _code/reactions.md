about: >
  <p>A GIF search app for Linux, integrating with the GNOME desktop environment.</p>
  <p>Reactions is written in the Zig programming language and uses GTK4 and libadwaita. It uses the GIPHY search API, but is intended to support multiple API providers.</p>
  <p>Reactions is a proof of concept to try working with C libraries in Zig, and also to try out GTK4. Hopefully it's a fun little app as well!</p>
