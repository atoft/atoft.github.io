about: >
  <p>Part One of a three part series of levels, WINNER of the PlanetPhillip.com BeginningVille level design competition for Half-Life 2: Episode 2. Awoken in the middle of the night, you find that your hideout is being raided by the Combine. Hopelessly outnumbered, you have no choice but to retreat into the forest and try to find safety. Your journey  will see you using a car, exploring dark mines and travelling by several other means.</p>
  <p>A video game level I created in under 24 Days, using the Source SDK. It includes custom textures, scripted sequences and voice acting.</p>
