about: >
  <p>In 2016 I helped organise an event in which teams
    of up to four students competed to create exciting original games.</p>
  <p>The event took place over 12 hours in the University of Cambridge
  Computer Laboratory and was open to students studying a wide range
  of subjects and with various levels of game development experience.</p>
  <p>The Game Gig was sponsored by Studio Gobo, who provided resources and
  expertise, and organised by the Hackers at Cambridge society. Around
  80 hackers took part and produced some amazing new games!</p>

  <p>As part of this, I also created the event's microsite for participants
  to use, which included a dynamic countdown timer and schedule, along with
  relevant links and information.</p>
