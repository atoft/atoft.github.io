about: <p>In 2016 I completed a summer internship with Studio Gobo. As part of the internship, I worked on implementing a cloud rendering system based on volumetric ray-marching. The project was implemented in Unity Engine using both C# and HLSL shaders.</p><p>I also helped produce a short report about some of the optimisations we investigated to allow such a system to run in real-time.</p>
