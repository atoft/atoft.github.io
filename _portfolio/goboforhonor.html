      As part of co-development with Ubisoft Montreal, we worked on the prototyping, implementation
      and design tools for a new PvE game mode, Arcade Mode, in the Anvil/Scimitar game engine. We created a procedural
      content system producing thousands of unique quests while ensuring a high level of designer control.
