about: >
  <p>
    As part of co-development with Ubisoft Montreal, we worked on the prototyping, implementation
    and design tools for a new PvE game mode, Arcade Mode, in the Anvil/Scimitar game engine. We created a procedural
    content system producing thousands of unique quests while ensuring a high level of designer control.
  </p>
  <p>As part of this project, some of the specific areas I helped to work on included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rapid iteration and playtesting of multiplayer game mode prototypes, adding new elements to the existing gameplay.</li>
    <li>A data-driven system allowing designers to specify the allowed combinations of content in procedural Arcade Mode quests. This included design-time authoring and the pipeline to produce the needed runtime data.</li>
    <li>QA tools to help survey and reproduce specific combinations of procedural content.</li>
    <li>Editor scripts to improve data authoring and review existing data.</li>
    <li>Validation scripts to ensure correct quests were generated, including validating the tagging of content, setup of level ingredients, and other design data.</li>
  </ul>
