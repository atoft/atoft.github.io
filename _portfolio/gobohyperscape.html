about: >
  <p>I am a gameplay programmer at Studio Gobo. We collaborated with Ubisoft Montreal on features for the battle royale game Hyper Scape, and helped develop several gameplay systems in C++.</p>
  <p>As part of this project, some of the specific areas I helped to work on included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Building a data-driven system for creating emotes, sprays, victory poses, and other cosmetic interactions, including triggering animations, spawning props and VFX, and affecting player locomotion, in a networked multiplayer environment.</li>
    <li> Expanding an existing game mode framework to support new unique modes, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Team and faction-based spawning, scoring and victory conditions.</li>
        <li>Adjusting existing gameplay data on the fly based on game mode rules.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Assisting on other areas of the project, including adding additional components to the gameplay system for building the "Hacks" abilities.</li>
  </ul>
