Here we are. Three years, nine terms, countless good times (and more than a few not-so-good) and my time at Cambridge has come to an end.

Things haven’t always gone smoothly, but somehow I’ve made it through in one piece. I’ve learnt a huge amount, albeit not in the subject I’d originally planned. I’ve become a computer scientist, written a dissertation and got a job making video games at the end of it. I’m not going to sugarcoat the stress, the workload and the challenges that we all face at Cambridge, but for better or worse, my time here has made me who I am today.

But far more valuable than anything I’ve learnt here are the relationships I’ve made along the way. Without the friends who helped me through the stress and the sadness, the chaos and the fun, I wouldn’t have made it to where I am now. So thank you for everything, and see you soon :)
