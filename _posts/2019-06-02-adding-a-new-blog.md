This is the first post in the new blog section of my website. I added this 
section mainly to archive various bits and pieces from elsewhere on the 
internet, and also for the occasional times when I feel the need to write 
about something.

Here's a few more details about how it works. The site is hosted on GitHub
Pages, which includes built-in support for a tool called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
Jekyll takes posts written in the Markdown text format, applies a template
writtem in specially annotated HTML, and produces a static website containing
your content. I've also been using this to generate the [project]({{site.url}}/#projects)
pages of the site, and now it generates a blog too. The Liquid template
features also let the blog be more integrated into the rest of the site, for
example generating links to related posts on other pages, and showing a nice
preview of the latest posts on the homepage.

The next challenge is to try and export some of the content from my old student
blog on Tumblr, which is no longer publically accessible, and automatically convert 
it into posts for this blog. After that, I'll probably forget to post anything
here for years...
