This post is a list of sites, books, and talks I've found useful working in games. These links might be helpful for you too if you're looking to get into the industry, or if you're there already. Programmers working in other contexts 
may get some use out of it, but no guarantees ðŸ™ƒ.

I'll try to update this page over time with more things!

# Game Programming Patterns - Robert Nystrom
**[Website](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)**  
**Useful for:** An introduction to common ways of solving problems in games.  
**Assuming:** You're somewhat familiar with any C-like language.  

An over-reliance on Design Patterns as a "silver bullet" for engineering problems is 
bad, but rather than prescribed solutions, this book presents examples of useful approaches to problems
 which turn up a lot in games. I've definitely seen (and used) these in the engines I've worked in. 

It's very accessible to beginners. I recommend the getting the paperback if you can, but 
the author provides the whole book online for free.

# Data-Oriented Design and C++ - Mike Acton
**[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc)**  
**Useful for:** Unlearn what you have learned (about object-oriented programming).  
**Assuming:** You have some C++ knowledge.

This talk is a good introduction to the ideas of data-oriented design, specifically, why caring about
the layout of your data in memory is very important for writing software with good performance.

# Simplicity: Not Just For Beginners - Kate Gregory
**[YouTube](https://youtu.be/n0Ak6xtVXno?t=55)**  
**Useful for:** How to think about your code.  
**Assuming:** You have some C++ knowledge.

Kate Gregory has a lot of great C++ talks, but this is a good one about the mindset we have when 
writing code. Writing simple code can be hard, but it's important.

# Computer Graphics - Inigo Quilez
**[Website](https://iquilezles.org/www/index.htm)**  
**Useful for:** Lots of resources for graphics, shaders and procedural generation.  
**Assuming:** You've used any shader language before.

This site is filled with all sorts of great snippets related to graphics programming, especially techniques for
ray-marching and procedural noise. (I even cited it in my dissertation ðŸ™‚)

The author also co-created [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), and worked at Pixar.

# Overwatch Gameplay Architecture and Netcode - Timothy Ford
**[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3aieHjyNvw)**  
**Useful for:** Learn about ECS and networking all in one hour!  
**Assuming:** You have some C++ knowledge.  

Of course there are dozens of great GDC talks for programmers, but as far as engine architecture goes, this one is 
great. It's a good introduction to the Entity Component System model, and to gameplay networking, in the context
of a triple A game.

# Game Engine Architecture - Jason Gregory
**[Book](https://www.gameenginebook.com/)**  
**Useful for:** A high level view of what game engines are and how they work, with a few specifics.  
**Assuming:**  You're familiar with any C-like language.  

This is the canonical text for game engine architecture, and it covers *a lot*. Personally I found a little 
too broad in scope when I first read it, but 
for an overview of what game engines do and to get started in most areas, this is a great reference.
