I'm super excited that LEGO Horizon Adventures is finally out in the wilds for everyone to play! 
I'm so proud to have been part of the team at Studio Gobo that helped bring the game to life, 
starting from early prototypes, all the way to shipping the game across multiple platforms,
and with both local and online multiplayer.

It was a great experience to work on the game from start to finish, and 
I learnt a lot along the way. As someone who's a fan of the Horizon games 
and grew up loving LEGO, this was a dream project for me. The game is a lot of fun and it's so great 
to see people enjoying it.

LEGO Horizon Adventures is available on PS5, Switch, and PC!
