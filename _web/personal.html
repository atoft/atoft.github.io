about: >
  <p>I've had a website of some kind since I was of primary school age. Starting out on the now
  defunt Yahoo GeoCities, previous sites have been created in Flash as well as from scratch in
  HTML and CSS. Other online projects have included, among others, 
  <a target="_blank" href="/uncertainty-principle">pages for mods</a>, and helping to run a blog for 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://save-lollipop-people.blogspot.co.uk/">a school campaign</a>.</p>
  <p>My current website, launched in November 2015, is based on the 
  <a target="_blank" href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize framework</a>, modified with custom CSS 
  and a few JavaScript additions here and there.</p>
  <p>Previous versions of my website are available to view, although I can't guarantee everything works.</p>
