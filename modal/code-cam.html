<h4>Cambridge Computer Science</h4>
<p>I'm in my second year of a BA Honours degree at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>My course includes programming in Java, C/C++, Standard ML, Prolog and other languages. 
It also has a strong theoretical emphasis as well as elements of Digital Electronics and 
hardware design.</p>
<p>The practical work I've undertaken on the course has included the design of an
instant messaging client and server, coding an external sort algorithm, a program
to display the Game of Life, and much more.</p>
<p>My CV is available on request.</p>
