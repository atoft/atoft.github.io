<h4>Secret of the Coast</h4>
<p>My entry to PlanetPhillip.com&#39s VerticalVille level design competition. Set on a quiet coastline in late afternoon, it is up to you to climb islands, descend cliffs and explore the mysteries of the Coast.</p>
<p>A map created for Half-Life 2 Episode 2 within ten days, it includes coastal, cave and Combine environments, as well as puzzles and combat.</p> 
<p> Released: September 2012</p>
