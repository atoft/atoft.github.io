<h4>Gravity Falls</h4>
<p>A level I created as an entry to the ForestVille level design competition. Working your way through the forest, via a couple of stops, you need to turn off a Combine power generator. Of course, they won&#39;t be happy about this, so expect some resistance!</p>
<p>A map created for Half-Life 2 Episode 2 within a time limit, it is set in a Forest environment and includes unique physics puzzles and combat.</p>
