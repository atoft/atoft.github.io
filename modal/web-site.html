<h4>Personal Pages</h4>
<p>I've had a website of some kind since I was of primary school age. Starting out on the now
defunt Yahoo GeoCities, previous sites have been created in Flash as well as from scratch in
HTML and CSS. Other online projects have included, among others, 
<a target="_blank" href="/uncertainty-principle">pages for mods</a>, and helping to run a blog for 
<a target="_blank" href="http://save-lollipop-people.blogspot.co.uk/">a school campaign</a>.</p>
<p>My current website, launched in November 2015, is based on the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize framework</a>, modified with custom CSS 
and a few JavaScript additions here and there.</p>
<p>Previous versions of my website are available to view, although I can't guarantee everything works:</p>
<p>2010-2014: <a target="_blank" href="/archive/2014">HTML/CSS Site</a></p>
<p>2008-2010: <a target="_blank" href="/archive/2009">Flash Site</a></p>
<p>2007: <a target="_blank" href="/archive/2014/images/homepage.jpg">Yahoo Site</a></p>
